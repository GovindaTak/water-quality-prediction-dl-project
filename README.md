# water-quality-prediction-dl-project
A deep learning project focused on predicting water quality using data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The project includes both regression and classification tasks to forecast the Water Quality Index (WQI) and categorize water quality (e.g., Good, Poor, Unsuitable for Drinking). The model incorporates advanced preprocessing.
