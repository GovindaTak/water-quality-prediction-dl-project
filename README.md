# Water Quality Prediction with Deep Learning  

## Overview  
Access to clean water is a fundamental human necessity, and understanding water quality is critical for ensuring public health and environmental sustainability. This project uses deep learning techniques to predict water quality based on data from the **Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), India**.  

The dataset includes chemical and physical water parameters, enabling predictions for:  
1. **Water Quality Index (WQI)** (Regression Task).  
2. **Water Quality Classification** (Classification Task).

## Features  

### **Data Preprocessing**  
- Imputed missing values using strategies based on geographical clusters.  
- Standardized numeric features with **MinMaxScaler** to optimize gradient descent.  
- Encoded categorical features using **OrdinalEncoder** for seamless processing.  

### **Feature Engineering**  
- Removed highly correlated features to mitigate multicollinearity issues.  
- Identified features with strong predictive capabilities for model input.  

### **Model Architecture**  
- Designed multi-task learning with two deep learning models:  
  - **Regression Model**: Predicts the continuous WQI.  
  - **Classification Model**: Categorizes water quality into five levels (e.g., Good, Poor).  
- Integrated the following techniques:  
  - **Batch Normalization** for faster convergence.  
  - **Dropout Regularization** to combat overfitting.  
  - **Leaky ReLU** activation for better gradient flow.  

### **Regularization and Optimization**  
- Utilized **Dropout**, **Batch Normalization**, and **L2 Regularization** for enhanced generalization.  
- Fine-tuned hyperparameters like dropout rates, learning rates, and hidden layers using **Optuna**.  

### **Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Regression Task**:  
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures prediction accuracy.  
  - **RÂ² Score**: Assesses variance explained by the model.  
- **Classification Task**:  
  - **Accuracy**: Overall prediction correctness.  
  - **F1-Score**: Balances precision and recall.
